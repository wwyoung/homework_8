    <div class="intro_body">Among all the cities I've lived in, Stockholm is my favorite.
        Partially because it's the very first foreign city I've visited in my life, from where I started to measure the world.
        I still remember the moment when that 20-year-old me landed on Stockholm in the summer twilight,
        and was enchanted by its sweetness at the first sight.
        For me, Stockholm is a city of natural beauty and social inclusiveness as well.
        Yet among all its characters, what fascinates me most is its extreme seasonal shift of day and night.
        I feel that Stockholm is like a sensitive creature with strong emotions and various facades,
        and each and every facade has its unique charm.</div>
