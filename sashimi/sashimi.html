    <div class="intro_body">As a typical 'foodie', I'm addicted to food across the world.
        However, among all kinds of food I appreciate, I consider Japanese food sashimi as the most special one.
        It takes my heart away mainly because it involves the minimum extent of cooking
        therefore keeps the taste as original as possible,
        yet it requires rather complicated cooking skills to make as the same time.
        Such contradiction contains an oriental philosophy concept that I admire, which
        declares that complexity and simpleness are often two sides of the same coin.</div>
