    <div class="intro_body">Severus Snape, a character in J.K Rowling's Harry Potter series,
        is my favorite virtual character of all time.
        What attracts me most is perhaps the mysterious complexity lying inside him:
        frailty and strength, ordinary and greatness,
        self-abasement and self-conceit,
        the yearning of power and the empathy towards the weak,
        each of these contradictory attribute co-exist as part of him.
        To some extent, I seek in him the richness of humanity,
        and each time I reread the story of him,
        I come up with some new understandings of human-beings.
        For me, he's already like an old friend of mine, and his story never ends with the book.
