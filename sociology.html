    <div class="intro_body">I've studied as a Sociology major at Tsinghua Univeristy from 2012 to 2016. In this 4-year journey,
        on the one hand, I dived into the ocean of academic readings with rational thinking;
        on the other hand, I also did some own-to-earth fieldwork to better understand the society.
        Sociology, as a way of both observing and interpreting,
        has definitely significantly shaped my personality.
        To conclude how it has influenced me in one sentence, I would like to quote what Wright Mills has said:
        "I have tried to be objective, I do not claim to be detached."
