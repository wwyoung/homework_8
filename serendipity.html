    <div class="intro_body">By introducing the word 'serendipity',
        I would like to disclose more of my personal values
        and share with you how I perceive this world.
        In my eyes, the world we are living in is like a giant box filled with uncertainties and surprises.
        For years we've tried too hard to describe how the world is well-structured and ruled by laws,
        both in natural sciences and social sciences,
        yet to some extent the world remains its mystery.
        I gradually acknowledge the tininess of individuals against the enormous or endless universe,
        and I'm therefore even more amazed by the beauty of nature, of life and of uncertainty.
        I'm not saying that human-beings are totally powerless and entirely passive against the world,
        but saying that for me,
        I'm always open-minded to see what unexpected treasures life will offer me in the next sunrise (or midnight, who knows).
